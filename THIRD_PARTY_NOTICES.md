## Historical provenance

Early historical versions used Lyall's MIT-licensed STALKER2Tweak as
reference/scaffolding. The current built production path no longer contains
identifiable Lyall-derived implementation. Historical MIT rights and
provenance are not altered by the v1.0+ Project license.

## External research tools

UE4SS, Ghidra, CUE4Parse, Serilog, Dumper-7, Ultimate ASI Loader, Oodle and
other external or research tools are not bundled in the production release
and are not relicensed or distributed by this repository.
